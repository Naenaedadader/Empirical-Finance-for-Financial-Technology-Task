Analytical Steps for Mobile Banking Adoption Study

Preparation

1. Define Research Objective: Investigate the socio-economic and demographic factors influencing mobile banking adoption.
2. Data Collection and Preprocessing:
- Gather panel data with variables like urbanization rate, GDP, internet usage, etc.
- Perform data cleaning, check for missing values, and handle incomplete data.
3. Unit Root Testing:
- Use Levin-Lin-Chu (LLC) test to confirm the stationarity of variables.
- Apply logarithmic transformations or first differences for non-stationary variables (e.g., Urbanpopulationoftotalpop).

Fixed Effects (FE) Model Analysis

1. Model Selection: Conduct a Hausman test to compare Fixed Effects (FE) and Random Effects (RE) models, selecting the FE model.
2. Variable Testing and Handling:
- Identify significant variables (e.g., Urbanpopulationoftotalpop and IndividualsusingtheInternet).
- Address endogenous variables and exclude non-significant ones.
3. Heteroskedasticity Testing: Use the Wald test to identify the presence of heteroskedasticity in the model.
4. Interpretation of Results:
- Urbanization and internet usage rates significantly influence mobile banking adoption.
- Variables like gender ratio and GDP per capita are not significant.

Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) Analysis

1. Reason for Using GMM: Address issues of endogeneity, heteroskedasticity, and autocorrelation found in the FE model.
2. Variable Handling:
- Use System GMM, combining first-differenced variables and lagged values as instruments.
- Remove problematic variables like gender_ratio that remain non-stationary.
3. GMM Estimation:
- Build a regression model incorporating lagged dependent variables and other explanatory variables.
- Use first differences and lagged values for estimation.
4. Diagnostic Testing:
- Arellano-Bond Test: Check for first- and second-order autocorrelation.
- Hansen Test: Validate the instruments used.
- Sargan Test: Examine over-identification restrictions.
5. Interpretation of Results:
- Lagged dependent variables highlight the time dependency of mobile banking adoption.
- Urbanization and GDP have significant impacts
